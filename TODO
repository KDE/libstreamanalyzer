- documentation
- make sure the applet displays fine if kicker is on the top of the screen
- add support for numeric < and > in the queries
- monitor the free disk space and make sure the indexer does not fill up the drive. this might be done with Solid or a call to a monitor with dbus. best is probably to let the client tell the server how much space is left
- add support for extended headers in tar files
  see e.g. http://www.ussg.iu.edu/hypermail/linux/kernel/0506.2/0417.html
- extract metadata from .sx*, od*, etc files, like author, etc (egon)
- a general SAX XML parsing framework (egon)
- enable zipinputstream for reading streamed archives that have the size at the end of the content
- use locate for search systemwide for filenames
- if no configuration was present, index the home directory per default
- <fosterfeld_> vandenoever: i would suggest to add IndexReader::query() version based on iterators
- add the option to not refresh status automatically
- get out a list of field names

- set the lib version numbers to 0.0.0 until we stabilize the api

quick way to parse desktop files according to dfaure:
[17:57] <dfaure> vandenoever: if you want to populate strigi with the list of installed apps, I suggest KService::allServices()
[17:57] <dfaure> this will get the list of services (parts and app) out of ksycoca quite fast
[17:57] <dfaure> much faster than parsing .desktop files.

- port KFilePlugin implementations to strigi analyzers:
  http://lxr.kde.org/ident?i=KFilePlugin

- add support for IPTC, see http://nets.ii.uam.es/neptuno/iptc/
- think about supporting very large files with nested files, such as 1 gb mailbox files

- svn mv src/streams/{R,r}eader.h
