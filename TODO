- documentation
- make sure the applet displays fine if kicker is on the top of the screen
- add support for numeric < and > in the queries
- monitor the free disk space and make sure the indexer does not fill up the drive. this might be done with Solid or a call to a monitor with dbus. best is probably to let the client tell the server how much space is left
- add support for extended headers in tar files
  see e.g. http://www.ussg.iu.edu/hypermail/linux/kernel/0506.2/0417.html
- extract metadata from .sx*, od*, etc files, like author, etc (egon)
- a general SAX XML parsing framework (egon)
- enable zipinputstream for reading streamed archives that have the size at the end of the content
- use locate for search systemwide for filenames
- if no configuration was present, index the home directory per default
