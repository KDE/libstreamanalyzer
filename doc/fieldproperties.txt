$URI(required)
  Unique resource identifier of the property. Internally properties are identified by this ID.

$PARENTURI
  URI of parent property. Parent relation is similar to inheritance. Usually child property
  introduces some specifics/limitations/implications compared to its parent.

$NAME(required), $LOCALIZED NAME
  Short user-friendly name. This is the name users will see when file metadata is displayed to them.

$DESCRIPTION(required), $LOCALIZED_DESCRIPTION
  User-friendly property description. This is the description of property suitable for tooltips.

$TYPE(required)
  Property data type.
  Valid values: string, string_enum, string_enum_ext, integer, float, boolean, datetime, binary.
  string_enum type is a property that can only take one of the list of valid values provided by $VALUES.
  string_enum_ext type is a property that can take any string value, however $values list provides some
  suggestions for the value of this property.

$VALUES(required if $TYPE=string_enum), $LOCALIZED_VALUES
  Property value constraints. Default =  no constraints.
  if $TYPE=string, $VALUES=validation regexp
  if $TYPE=string_enum, $VALUES=value1|value2|value3
  if $TYPE=string_enum_ext, $VALUES=value1|value2|value3|(regexp or *)
  if $TYPE=integer|datetime|float, $VALUES=min_value,max_value,decimal_digits (all parameters are optional)
                     Is it possible that we may have to enumerate ints/floats instead of providing ranges? 
  Another option is to unite string(_enum)?(_ext)? just by defining a common regexp template for these and
  trying to parse it, since regexp in the form of value|value|value(|*) is quite intuitive and devs don't
  have to be aware of the implications.  //TODO

$MIN_CARDINALITY
  Minimum cardinality. Minimum number of properties of this type you must set for a given file.
  Lets specify mandatory properties. If omitted, default value is 0.

$MAX_CARDINALITY
  Maximum cardinality. Maximum number of properties of this type you can set for a given file.
  If omitted, default value is infinity.

$IS_INTRINSIC
  Is this property intrinsic to a file or provided by the user. Default = true.

$IS_WRITABLE
  Is this property writable. Default = TBD.  //TODO

$INDEXING
  Values=fulltext, atomic, none, TBD. Default = TBD. //TODO

$RELEVANCE
  Defines how relevance of the file is affected if a match is found in this field. Default = 1.0

$COMMENT
  Developer comment. Users won't see this.
