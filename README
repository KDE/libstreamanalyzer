Kitten

For my personal use I've written the jstreams classes that allow one to easily read nested files. These have proven very fast and have been included in the clucene c++ search engine. These classes would also be a cool extension to the kio plugins for allowing the user to browse e.g. files in a zip file that is stored in an email attachment. Another use would be to write a crawler that can gather information from all files in the filesystem even if they are hidden in emails or archives. I intended to add this feature to Kat, but because of the slowdown in the Kat project the latest Kat development version is not complete and does not build.

So I developed a small daemon that can index information using the new crawler. Now i've reached a point that the crawler is very stable and fast. How fast exactly depends on you system. It comes complete with a simple gui to controll the daemon and to search. I've named the thing Kitten, because I hope it grows into a Kat.

Here are the main features of Kitten:
- very fast crawling
- very small memory footprint
- no hammering of the system
- pluggable backend, currently sqlite3, but clucene is almost finished too
- communication between daemon and search program over an abstract interface, this is currently  a simple socket but implementation of dbus is a possibility. There's a small perl program in the code as an example of how to query. This is so easy that any KDE app could implement this.
- simple interface for implementing plugins for extracting information. we'll try to reuse the kat plugins, although native plugins will have a large speed advantage
- calculation of sha1 for every file crawled (allows fast finding of duplicates)


How to obtain and build ArchiveReader from SVN?
-----------------------------------------------

Execute these commands:

 svn co svn://anonsvn.kde.org/home/kde/trunk/playground/base/kitten
 ./rebuild.sh

If you want to use the GUI, you need to have >= Qt 4.1.2 installed. On Debian and Kubuntu, you can do this with 'sudo apt-get install libqt4-*'.

usage:
start Kitten by running 'kittenclient'
