 - Added deepfind and deepgrep, programs that are enhanced versions of find
   and grep.

   This is convenient for debugging and can also used by other programs that
   do not want to write their own indexer. It makes the superior Strigi
   indexer available to other software in a convenient way.
 - More versatile filters that determine which files to index. (Flavio
   Castelli)
 - Add possibility to index files from the client by feeding the file into the
   daemon. This opens the way to indexing email from remote servers and web
   pages.
