0.5.6
 - Added Xesam User Language parser. Now it will be possible to handle Xesam UserLanguage queries (http://wiki.freedesktop.org/wiki/XesamUserSearchLanguage).
 - Replaced .ini-based ontology parser with RDF/XML one.
 - Updated strigicmd: now it's possible to perform searches formulated
 following xesam userlanguage specifications.
 - Improved ontology introspection API: properties and classes now have child lists and applicable classes/properties lists.
 - change IndexReader::getFiles to IndexReader::getChildren.
 - removed IndexReader::documentId and IndexReader::mTime.
 - loads of build issues fixed
 - added a script that helps you to find the patch that broke a unit test
 - add fieldname for document content per the Xesam standard.
 - lots more
0.5.5
 - GUI now uses a .ui file making future improvements much easier
 - install detection script for ease of use in other cmake projects
 - modifying the signature of endAnalysis to endAnalysis(bool complete) 
   for StreamLineAnalyzer, StreamEventAnalyzer, and StreamSaxAnalyzer
 - add a function to AnalyzerConfiguration that tell how many bytes can 
   be read at most from a stream
 - add an SAX analyzer plugin that extracts the namespaces used in XML
   documents. With this it possible to get all XML documents that contain e.g.
   Chemical Markup Language or Dublin Core.
 - add a stream for changing the encoding of an incoming stream on the fly
 - use the new encoding stream to do better email parsing
 - add m3u stream analyzer.
 - add simple test program for strigi xesam query builder. It loads a file
   containing the xesam query. It converts the xesam query into a Strigi::Query
   object. It serializes the Strigi::Query object to xml for e.g. quality
   control.
 - add xesamquery option to strigicmd: now it's possibile to make queries
   using Xesam language.
 - add XesamQueryLanguage queries support. Now is possibile to translate
   xesam queries formulated using XesamQueryLanguage into Strigi::Query objects.
 - add a cgi executable that takes multipart/form-data and outputs an analysis
   of the data as xml
 - give xmlindexer the ability to read from stdin
 - big improvement in parsing ms word files
 - better input sanity checking. thanks to zzuf for reporting the errors
 - cleanup of private variables in classes by introducing a d-pointer

0.5.4
 - simplify PollingListener by letting it reuse code from DirAnalyzer
 - improve parsing speed by reading incrementally large blocks and only if no throughanalyzer is ready yet
 - extract more data from ogg and ID3 files
 - new registerField(fieldname) function that gets additional data from the
   ontology
 - support of indexwriter calls: addValue(index, field, data, size),
   addValue(index, field, double_value) to CLucene backend.
 - enable passing of "Tokenized" flag parameter to CLucene backend
 - support for the Keyword Terms which are not tokenized during queries
 - handling of optional indexing flags, which are loaded from the ontology
 - handling of cardinality constraint when indexing
 - add keyword query type which allows for using keywords that are not split
   up. e.g. chemistry.molecular_formula#"C 4 H 10". basically "#" sign tells --    do not tokenize
 - parse the userlanguage wrapped in xesam query language xml
 - add searialization to xml for Strigi::Query and Strigi::Term, useful for
   debugging purposes
 - add types from the xesam dbus interface to strigitypes.h
 - add support for gif files
 - add support for analyzing jpeg files.
 - add prioritized, multithreaded queue for incoming requests
 - add option --lastfiletoskip to diranalyzer and xmlindexer
 - add support for Cc: Bcc: Message-ID: In-Reply-To: References: From: and To:
 - add exclude and include filters to strigicmd create and update commands
 - add deindex option, it can be used for removing dirs or files from an index
   created by strigi

0.3.11
 - SunOS, BSD, 64 bit and Coverity compatibility fixes
 - Search in a set of default fields and not just in the text content of a file, if no specific field is specified.
 - Add histogram widget to simple search client
 - Add support for Ogg Vorbis
 - Better decoding of email headers
 - Expand Query object to handle nested queryies
 - Fix highlighting and display of title in search results.
 - Fix path for the child indexables
 - Fix memory problems in archivereader
 - Check for too short file names and omit the RPM trailer from the results.
 - Add an additional unit test for the RPM stream provider.
 - Revert raise() to kill(getpid()) because raise hangs the thread.
 - Install qtdbus library for strigi.

0.3.10
 - Convienience classes for using Strigi over Qt 4.2 DBus
 - Change buildsystem to allow building of deepfind, deepgrep and xmlindexer
   separately
 - Speedup of deepfind by selectively using only the analyzers deepfind needs
 - Many portability fixes (GCC 3, Forte, MSVC)
 - New, more efficien plugin loading
 - Add IFilter plugin for the Windows version
 - Remove the big Strigi lock (faster indexing)
 - Switch strigiclient to communicate of DBus instead of over a unix socket
 - Reorganization of the indexer with a new IndexerConfiguration
 - Improvements of file name filters
 - New Qt widget for configuring file name filters
 - Add file name setting to the DBus interface
 - Move verbose unit tests
 - Bugfixes in some streams

0.3.9
 - Added deepfind and deepgrep, programs that are enhanced versions of find
   and grep.
 - Added a new way of storing the configuration in an xml file.
 - Added a way to search in multiple indexes.
 - Added xmlindexer, a program that outputs the file parsing results as xml.
   This is convenient for debugging and can also used by other programs that
   do not want to write their own indexer. It makes the superior Strigi
   indexer available to other software in a convenient way.
 - More versatile filters that determine which files to index. (Flavio
   Castelli)
 - Add possibility to index files from the client by feeding the file into the
   daemon. This opens the way to indexing email from remote servers and web
   pages.
