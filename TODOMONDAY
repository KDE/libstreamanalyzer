* seek and replace getFoo() functions with foo() in daemon/client
* replace the AnalyzerConfiguration* with AnalyzerConfiguration& in diranalyzer

* (trueg): - remove IndexReader::documentId
           - change mTime to take the file path as argument
           (Reason: the document id is very implementation specific, we cannot expect
                    an indexer to have any numeric IDs. And in the end the only usage
                    of the id is in daemon/indexreader.cpp:
                    reader->mTime(reader->documentId(event->getPath()));
                    That is just utterly useless.)
