* seek and replace getFoo() functions with foo() in daemon/client?
* Make AnalysisResult usage in IndexWriter consistent:
  - Make it a const argument in startAnalysis
  - make AnalysisResult::mWriterData mutable
  - make AnalysisResult::setWriterData const
* give all analyzers a common ancestor
* give this ancestor a dptr with at least a vector with the registered fields
  this will allow us to ask the factory which fields the analyzer can provide.
* mv addField functions to addValue in IndexWriter
