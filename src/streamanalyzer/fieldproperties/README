How to add fields/classes:

Fieldproperties file name must look like this: namespace_class.fieldproperties

If you introduce a new namespace, there must be a corresponding file [namespace].namespace.

xesam namespace is used for xesam-provided ontology.

strigi namespace is to be used only for strigi custom extensions over xesam.

You should consider having your own namespace if the analyzers you provide are not typically distributed with strigi and instead are installed along with your app.

Important:

Field names should be namespace-unique, not class-unique
Classes must be namespace-unique.
Of course, the less naming clashes we have, the better. These are absolute minimums.

Naming:

Class names are CamelCased. Field names are camelCased, that is first letter is lowercase.
Namespaces start with lowercase.

Note:

The file format itself is temporary. Strigi will adopt whatever format xesam comes up with.
