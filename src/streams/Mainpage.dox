/** @mainpage JStreams
 *
 * The JStreams classes provide a way of accessing streamed
 * resources in manner similar to the Java interface
 * java.io.InputStream.
 *
 * If you are writing an analyzer, you probably want to know
 * about the jstreams::InputStream, which is just an (abstract)
 * instance of jstreams::StreamBase, with char as the template
 * parameter.  This latter class is the one all Stream classes
 * are derived from, and override the methods of.
