<h4>STUFF FOR STUDENTS AND AUTHORS:</h4>

<b>Keyboards:</b><br>
      Once you choose Japanese as your language, you will be offered five keyboard choices: 
Roman-to-Kanji, Roman-to-Kana Only, JIS Hiragana Keyboard, JIS Katakana Keyboard and 
Kanji by shape (Soketsu). Notice that the author may toggle back and forth between two languages 
using the F3 key (convenient for text that has a blend of Japanese and English).  Following are 
descriptions of each keyboard:

<p><b>                              Roman-to-Kanji                       </b><br>
      This keyboard will transform your Roman characters into kana or kanji. WinCALIS 2.0 and 
WinCALIS Author 2.0 support the two most common systems for transliterating Japanese in 
Roman characters: 1) the Hepburn system; and 2) the &quot;Kunrei&quot; system. Some Japanese 
word-processing systems allow many non-standard ways of entering Japanese in romanized form
(e.g., &quot;ca&quot; for &quot;ka,&quot; &quot;jya&quot; for &quot;ja/zya,&quot; etc.). Refer to the kana chart to see how each character may 
be accessed in WinCALIS. Keep in mind also the following peculiarities.

<p><b>   Typing Object Markers</b><br>
<ul>
<li> to type   を, an object marker, you must type &quot;w-o&quot;.  If you type &quot;o&quot;, you will get お.
<li> to type は as an object marker, like in the sentence &quot;私は学生です&quot;, you must type 
&quot;h-a&quot;, even though it is pronounced  &quot;wa&quot;.  If you type &quot;w-a&quot;, you will get わ.
</ul>
<p><b>   Typing Tiny Characters</b><br>
<ul>
<li> WinCALIS will include the tiny &quot;っ&quot; within words, e.g.: いってif &quot;i-t-t-e&quot; is inputted, or 
さっちゃん for &quot;s-a-t-c-h-a-n-n&quot;.  You may also get a っ by typing &quot;x-t-u&quot; (or any of the 
other combinations as found in the kana chart listed under that character). The pattern for 
typing a small character in isolation is to precede it with either an &quot;x&quot; or an &quot;l&quot; (capital &quot;X&quot; and 
&quot;L&quot; for katakana).  
</ul>
<p><b>   Typing &quot;ん&quot;   </b><br>
<ul><li> ん has some peculiarities. To type ん at the end of a word, you must type &quot;n-n&quot;.  But if you 
want to type a word where ん is not followed by a な gyo, you can just type one &quot;n&quot;.  e.g.: to get 
こんど, you would type &quot;k-o-n-d-o&quot;.  If ん is followed by a な gyo, e.g.: to get 
さんにん, you would have to type &quot;s-a-n-n-n-i-n-n&quot;.  If the word is followed by an あ gyo, 
then you must also type two &quot;n&quot;s, e.g.: &quot;s-i-n-n-a-i&quot; for しんあい.
</ul>
<p><b>   Typing vowel extensions</b><br>
<ul><li> In order to get the long &quot;o&quot; sound, the user must actually type in &quot;u&quot;, e.g.: type &quot;k-y-o-u&quot; in order 
to get きょう. For katakana, use the dash &quot;-&quot; for vowel extensions.
</ul>
<p><b>   Typing in Katakana</b><br>
<ul><li> to type in katakana, simply press Shift or CapsLock, or type in hiragana and then convert to 
katakana with the spacebar. As you may have noticed on the kana chart, there are a few
unconventional combinations of characters. These will probably be used more for foreign words, 
e.g: type in &quot;f-o- - -m-u&quot;, then press the Spacebar, then Enter to accept the katakana conversion to 
the English word &quot;form&quot;, which is in the program dictionary.  You will however, have to type in 
capitals in order to get proper nouns in katakana.
</ul>
<p><b>   Typing Numbers</b><br>
<ul><li> you may convert arabic numbers to kanji, e.g.:１００ to 百.
</ul>

<h4>THE BUFFER</h4>
      There are important things to know about buffers when you are typing Japanese. If the 
characters are not black, you are in an active buffer and you must do something to clear the buffer. 
If the computer beeps at you, it means that you are trying to do something outside of the active 
buffer, and you must clear it (by pressing Enter) before you can continue. 

<p>When in the Roman-to-Kanji keyboard, this is the process for entering text:

<p>1) When you type hiragana, the letters will appear blue (active buffer).  If you want the words to 
remain in hiragana, simply press Enter.

<p>2) If you want to convert the words into kanji, press the spacebar, while the characters are still blue. 
 Kanji will replace the words in blue and the sentence will appear red (active buffer).  If all 
conversions are correct, press Enter (Note: The maximum length of a phrase to be converted is 32 
characters.  When you type the 32nd character, the phrase will automatically be converted).

<p>3) If any conversions are incorrect, do the following while the characters are still red.  The reverse 
video block is your bunsetsu.  Simply move the bunsetsu over the inappropriate conversion and 
press the Spacebar.  The homophone list will appear on the screen.  Move the arrows to the desired 
kanji,  then press Enter.  The selected kanji will appear in the phrase in reverse video.  If this is 
correct, press Enter again.
<br>Note:  THE HOMOPHONE LIST<br>
      When you choose a kanji off the homophone list, the program will &quot;remember&quot; that one and 
present it next time the same kana are entered. The kanji most frequently used will be given priority 
over the other homophones (this does not rearrange the homophone list, which is constant.  Here, 
a separate user history file is being created and constantly updated).

<p>4) WinCALIS divides your sentence into bunsetsu blocks as its dictionary sees fit, but you may 
change these blocks.  First, convert back to hiragana by choosing it from the list (if you try to 
change the bunsetsu while there is still Kanji within the active buffer, you will get a pop up 
message reminding you to convert).  Use the shifted left arrow to mark the first bunsetsu.  At this 
point, you may convert that block by pressing the spacebar, or use the arrow keys to &quot;jump&quot; from 
block to block.  To continue to change bunsetsu blocking, move to the block that you would like 
to adjust, and use the shifted right and left arrow keys to shrink or expand it.

<p>5) The user may find it helpful to clear the buffer (press Enter) early and often while working in the 
Roman-to-Kanji keyboard so the bunsetsu stay manageable. This will be convenient both for 
maintaining kana, and in locating the desired kanji. It is especially helpful when typing honorific 
prefixes: first type the prefix &quot;お&quot; or &quot;ご&quot;, then press Enter to clear the active conversion buffer, 
then type the rest of the noun phrase and convert it.  If the homophone list does not display the 
character you want, try changing the blocking of the bunsetsu. With use, you will become 
more familiar with how the transliteration process occurs within WinCALIS.  

<p>Look at the following passage, and notice the bunsetsu blocks -- the bars indicate the points where 
conversions may be most efficiently placed (where the spacebar should be pressed):
<blockquote>　
　  「ユーザーフレンドリ」｜と｜呼ばれる｜
　　りゆうは、ごく ｜普通の｜人がごく｜
　　関単に  ｜使用 ｜方法を｜マスター｜でき、｜
　　毎日の｜タイプ ｜ の ｜仕事にすぐ  ｜ 
　　役立てることができることからきている。｜
</blockquote>
<p>This passage includes hiragana, katakana, kanji, and punctuation, so it is a nice exercise routine for
typing Japanese.  Notice how each bunsetsu is entered:
<blockquote>　　
　　よばれる　　　　－　　　 　呼ばれる
　　りゅうは、ごく　－　　　　 理由は、ごく
　　ふつうの　　　　－　　　　普通の
　　ひとがごく　　　－　　　　人がごく
　　かんたんに　　　－　　　　簡単に
　　しよう　　　　　－　　　　使用
　　ほうほうを　　　－　　　　方法を
　　まいにちの　　　－　　　　毎日の
　　しごとにすぐ　　－　　　　仕事にすぐ
　　やくだてることができることからきている。－
　　役立てることができることからきている。
</blockquote>

<p><b>                              Roman-to-Kana Only </b><br>
      This keyboard lets you type in kana characters without going through the buffer, so you need not 
press Enter for each bunsetsu (refer to the kana chart to see how it accepts transliteration). It will 
automatically change Roman characters into hiragana; katakana may be accessed by pressing Shift 
or CapsLock.

<p><b>                              JIS Kana Keyboards</b><br>

      These keyboards transform the QWERTY keyboard into one that directly enters kana 
characters, according to the Japanese Industrial Standard. For a display of the corresponding 
keyboard, click on Help, and choose Keyboard Help. 
<ul>
<li> To type a voiced kana (marked with &quot;dakuten&quot; two dots), first type the key for its unmarked 
unvoiced counterpart, then press the &quot;dead key,&quot; (F2), then press the &quot;dakuten&quot; accent key, 
which is the key marked with double quote &quot; (the shifted single quote ' key). For example, to 
type が, first type か (the &quot;t&quot; key), then press the dead key (F2), ( か will appear in reverse 
video), then press the &quot;dakuten&quot; accent key (&quot;).

<li> To type a kana beginning with the &quot;p&quot; sound (marked with &quot;handakuten&quot; circle), first type 
the key for its unmarked counterpart, then press the &quot;dead key,&quot; the key marked F2, then press 
the &quot;handakuten&quot; accent key, which is the &quot;o&quot; key (the letter &quot;o&quot; suggests the little circle 
diacritic). For example, to type ぴ, first type ひ (the &quot;v&quot; key), then press the dead key (F2), 
(ひ will appear in reverse video), then press the &quot;handakuten&quot; accent key (o).
</ul>

<p><b>                              Kanji by shape (Soketsu)</b><br>
Kanji characters are composed of &quot;root&quot; shapes.  Instead of retrieving a character by its 
pronunciation, this keyboard allows the user to locate a character by its looks; by elements of its 
root structure. This is especially helpful in situations where you know what the character looks like, 
but not how it is pronounced. The root structures are accessed by choosing the Kanji-by-shape 
(Soketsu) keyboard, and clicking on the piano-keyboard-style buttons.  Notice that the database 
requires you to preface any duplicate characters with the &quot;X&quot; key, 重複。 
 

<h4>STUFF SPECIFICALLY FOR AUTHORS:</h4>
     Authoring a Japanese WinCALIS lesson can be done, for the most part, according to the manual.  
There are, however, a few variations that arise because of the  integration of two different languages 
and four different alphabets.  Besides keeping in mind all of the quirks of typing in Japanese text, the 
author must consider how the text content is processed and presented to the student. 

<p><b>  Preparing Students for the Mechanics of the Lesson</b><br>
<ul>
<li> In the directions box, the author may want to tell the students more than just &quot;Fill in the blanks.&quot;  
The students may need reminding on how to access different keyboards; what keyboard they should 
have for the lesson; and any other information that would help them in the mechanics of the lesson.  
Remember that, in the &quot;Roman to Kanji&quot; keyboard, the student must 1) be in the right keyboard, 2) 
type in their answer, 3) If necessary, choose a kanji off the homophone list, 4) Clear the buffer (by 
pressing Enter), and finally: 5) Enter their answer. 
</ul>
<p><b>   Typing in Two Languages</b><br>
<ul><li> Toggling between two languages can be done either by: clicking and dragging the 
mouse on the language choice from the options list; pressing F3 to toggle to the language at the top 
of the language list (usually English); or by clicking and dragging with the right-hand mouse button.  
 </ul>
<p><b>   &quot;Cloze Exercise&quot; Hints</b><br>
<ul><li> The cloze exercise in WinCALIS may be finicky with Japanese.  Since the program is very 
specific about what is marked within the text, it is also specific about what the student enters. Since 
Japanese is entered differently than English, e.g.: you must enter &quot;n-i&quot;, two characters, in English in 
order to access the single Japanese character &quot;に&quot; (or seven letters for the single character 私！), 
the author should choose a fixed blank length so that the student is able to type in the answer.  
</ul>
<p><b>   ABC  and ＡＢＣ</b><br>
<ul><li> Full width Roman characters are accessed by typing Ctrl, Shift, and the character. This provides 
aesthetic appeal in situations where Roman characters are included within Japanese text, such as 
ＸＹＺ会社．
</ul>
<p><b>   Punctuation in Japanese</b><br>
<li> Setting aside keyboard exploration time may make entering Japanese text easier. Because 
Japanese uses some punctuation that is exclusive to Japanese, the characters may be hidden 
from view on the standard English keyboard.  Most of the punctuation parallels the basic 
keyboard, but it is in a 'zenkaku', full-width form.  The keyboard layout is displayed by clicking 
on Help and dragging to Keyboard Help.  Here are a few marks that are specific to the Japanese 
language, and how to produce them:
<center><table><tr align=center><td>
<b>To produce a:	                <br>
－ (dash)                         <br>
．(bold period)                <br>
・(bullet)                          </b></td><td>
<b>type this:  <br>
~<br>
^<br>
/</b></td></tr></table></center>


<p><b>   &quot;Wild Card&quot; Hints</b><br>
<ul><li> The wild card feature is accessed by using a very specific set of characters.  Notice that these 
characters must be reproduced exactly if they are to be used as wild cards. For example, the 
ampersand &quot;&&quot;, the asterisk &quot;*&quot;, the bar &quot;|&quot; and the braces &quot;{}&quot; must be entered in this ANSI 
form -- not the full-width form sized to Japanese writings (＆、＊、｜、「」).
</ul>
        
<p><b>                 KANA  KODE  KEY (or: how to enter kana characters while retaining sanity)</b><br>
In order to get a kana character, you must type in one set of Roman letter(s) listed underneath it. 
The first line of romaji is the Kunrei system. Where applicable, the second line is the Hepburn 
system, and the third is nonstandard.  As an example of usage of this chart: in order for a づ to 
appear, you input &quot;d-u&quot; or &quot;d-z-u&quot;.
